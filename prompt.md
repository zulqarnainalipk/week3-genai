## 3.  Academic Paper Review


> I’d like you to review a research paper I’ve written. Please evaluate its clarity, structure, argument strength, academic tone, and originality. Highlight any logical inconsistencies, grammar issues, or areas that need stronger evidence or clearer presentation. A section-by-section critique would be ideal.
